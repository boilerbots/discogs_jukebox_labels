I want to use Discogs to catalog all my jukebox singles.

I want to be able to print jukebox title strips from those collections.

## **WORK IN PROGRESS**
## How to use this

1. In Discogs create a custom folder for each jukebox you own.
2. Move your collection items to the appropriate folder (jukebox).
3. Change the **discogs_collection_folder** in the yaml file.
4. Run the script and view the generated PDF file.
